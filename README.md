## Overview

This project presents an optimized digital library architecture built for **large-scale textual analysis**. The system is engineered to support fast, memory-efficient keyword search and text processing by leveraging:

- Custom hash tables with multiple collision resolution strategies
- Dynamic resizing mechanisms
- Lightweight dictionary compression techniques

Designed for scalability and extensibility, this system enables robust handling of large datasets and efficient extraction of unique textual elements.
